<h1>About</h1>
<p>
	The feature of <a href="http://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Remote_import_path_syntax">Vanity Imports</a> (or
	<em>remote import paths</em>, as they are called in the reference) have been implemented for a while,
	but does not seem to be used that often. I assume, because it makes you maintain an HTML header section.
	This is, what ImportAlias will do <em>for</em> you.
</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>
	I tried to keep it as simple as possible. You don't need to remember any credentials, I only
	offer 3rd party login. Right now I support <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> and
	<a href="http://google.com">Google</a>. Just click the Login button in the top right corner.
</p>
<p>
	Before you can add an alias route, you need to <em>claim</em> a domain.
	Right now, a domain can be managed by one person (one account) only. The architecture
	has been designed to support delegates, but the functionality has not been exposed just yet.
	To verify that you are actually the owner of the domain you are about to claim,
	a DNS request is made to check, if said domain contains a TXT record containung
	your UID. The DNS request is made against <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/">Google’s DNS</a>
	and not resolved manually so give the record some time to propagate.
</p>
<p class="well">
	<span class="badge badge-info">Example:</span> Let’s assume you want to claim
	the domain <code>surmair.de</code>. Go to your DNS provider and make an entry
	for <code>_importalias.surmair.de</code> and set the content to your UID. You
	can find your UID (as well as your personal API key) in the dropdown in the
	navigation bar at the top.
</p>
<p>
	Now that you have your domain you can add aliases. Each alias has some information
	saved about them:
	<dl class="well">
		<dt>Alias</dt>
		<dd>
			The path which should be aliased for a remote repository. It may contain multiples slashes.
		</dd>
		<dt>Repository</dt>
		<dd>
			Type and URL of said repository. At the moment Git, Mercurial and Bazaar
			are supported by <code>go get</code>.
		</dd>
		<dt>Forward URL</dt>
		<dd>
			The URL to forward to when it is accessed by something else than <code>go get</code> (e.g. a browser).
		</dd>
	</dl>
</p>
<h2>Alpha</h2>
<p>
	<span class="badge badge-important">Important:</span> I give this service the “alpha stage” mark.
	Nothing has been tested in the wild and I will not give any guarantees. If you rely on your Go imports
	and need them to work 24/7, do not use this service just yet.
</p>
<p>
	Also: What are you doing, that you need your imports to work 24/7?!
</p>
<h2>The name</h2>
<p>
	The name sucks badly, I know. But my ideas are either really boring or have no connection whatsoever
	to the project. If you happen to have a suggestion, <a href="mailto:surma@surmair.de">drop me a line</a>.
	I am grateful for any idea.
